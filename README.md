# 18FallAlgorithm
Sogang Univ. 18 Fall Semester Assignment
---------------------------------------
## Assignment 1: Maximum Subsequence Sum

1. Goal
    + Finding a subsequence which has the maximum subsequence.
    + Understanding how each algorithm works.

2. How to run file
    1. use makefile to make binary file
    2. the input form must be 
    > ./[mms201XXXXX] [inputfile] [algorithm index]
    example
    ```bash
    ./mms20171635 input00001.txt 1
    ```

3. Time Complexity of Index
    1. O(n^2)
    2. O(nlogn)
    3. O(n)

4. Result File: result_[inputfilename].txt
    1st line: input file name
    2nd line: algorithm index
    3rd line: input size (the number of elements in the original sequence)
    4th line: index of the leftmost number in the subsequence found
    5th line: index of the rightmost number in the subsequence found
    6th line: sum of the subsequence
    7th line: running time in milliseconds

-------------------------------------------
## Assignment 2: Master of Sorting

1. Goal
    + Understand performance of different sorting algorithms.

2. To be continued.......
